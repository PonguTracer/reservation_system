# 11.2.1: Amusement park ride reservation system.

The following (unfinished) program implements a digital line queuing system for an amusement park ride. The system allows a rider to reserve a place in line without actually having to wait. The rider simply enters a name into a program to reserve a place. Riders that purchase a VIP pass get to skip past the common riders up to the last VIP rider in line. VIPs board the ride first. (Considering the average wait time for a Disneyland ride is about 45 minutes, this might be a useful program.) For this system, an employee manually selects when the ride is dispatched (thus removing the next riders from the front of the line).

Complete the following program, as described above. Once finished, add the following commands:

The rider can enter a name to find the current position in line. (Hint: Use the list.index() method.)
The rider can enter a name to remove the rider from the line.
